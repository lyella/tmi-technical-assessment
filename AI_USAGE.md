# AI Usage Documentation

## AI Tools Used

**Primary Tool:** GitHub Copilot  
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via GitHub Copilot Chat)

## How AI Was Used

### 1. Code Generation and Boilerplate
- Used Copilot for generating TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- Generated boilerplate code for React components
- Created initial structure for Redux slices and store configuration

### 2. Component Development
- Assisted with creating reusable React components (ProductCard, CartItem, etc.)
- Helped implement responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS
- Generated loading and empty state components

### 3. API Integration
- Used AI to help structure API service functions
- Assisted with error handling patterns for fetch requests
- Generated type-safe API response handlers

### 4. State Management
- Helped design Redux Toolkit slice structure
- Assisted with implementing cart logic (add, remove, update quantities)
- Generated localStorage persistence logic

### 5. Problem Solving
- Used AI chat to troubleshoot TypeScript type errors
- Asked for suggestions on handling edge cases (empty cart, API errors)
- Got help with Next.js 15 App Router patterns

### 6. Code Review and Optimization
- Used AI to review code for potential improvements
- Asked for suggestions on accessibility improvements
- Got recommendations for responsive design breakpoints

## Areas Where AI Was Not Used

- Overall application architecture and design decisions
- Business logic and feature requirements interpretation
- Manual testing and bug fixes
- Git workflow and version control
- Final code review and quality assurance

## Limitations Encountered

- AI suggestions sometimes used outdated Next.js patterns
- Had to manually adjust some TypeScript types for better accuracy
- Required manual verification of Tailwind CSS class names
- Some generated code needed refactoring for better readability

## Estimated Time Saved

Using AI tools reduced development time by approximately 30-40%, particularly in:
- Writing repetitive code structures
- TypeScript type definitions
- Component boilerplate
- Documentation and comments
